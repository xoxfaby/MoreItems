# MoreItems

A simple mod that adds more items to the game, intended to be balanced and fit well into the vanilla game. 

#### THIS MOD IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND MAY HAVE BUGS

A lot of the assets in this mod are placeholder assets.
I highly recommend that when using this mod ( or any mod ) you understand that bugs can happen.

## Items:

### White:
- Serrated Knife: Your critical strikes do more damage.

### Green:
- Static Charge: Your critical strikes build up static charge to shock the next enemy to attack you.

### Red:
 - None yet, make a suggestion!

### - Lunar:
 - Cracked Orb: You have an extra chance to duplicate your attacks, but an equal chance to duplicate attacks that hit you.
 - Serrated Spoon: Your critical chance is always low, but your critical strikes get more damage from effects that add critical chance.
